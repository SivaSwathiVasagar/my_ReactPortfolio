# Software Engineering Portfolio

This is a React static portfolio I developed for job hunting. I've utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript and REACT to demonstrate that I understand the fundamentals of these technologies.

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SivaSwathiVasagar/my_ReactPortfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd my_ReactPortfolio`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.

## Deployment

The website is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for easy access. You can visit the live site at [Siva Swathi Vasagar's Portfolio](https://sivaswathivasagar.github.io/my_ReactPortfolio/).

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the open-source community and the creators of the tools and libraries used in this project. Special thanks to [React](https://reactjs.org/) for providing a powerful and efficient framework for building user interfaces.

Feel free to explore the source code, suggest improvements, or reach out for collaboration opportunities!
